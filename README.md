# chess960x4x2
Chess960x4x2 is an extended variant of Chess 960. In this game:

Instead of the Queen (which moves like a Rook and Bishop combined), players have the option to choose between:
- Hawk (moves like a Knight and Bishop)
- Elephant (moves like a Knight and Rook)
- Amazon (moves like a Knight, Bishop, and Rook)

Players can also decide whether they have the ability to promote pawns to either the original major pieces (Q, H, E, A) present at the game's start or to all major pieces.

- Option one allows promotion to a Knight, Bishop, and Rook, along with one major piece chosen at the beginning.
- Option two permits promotion to Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, Hawk, Elephant, and Amazon.

This provides more initial position options (960 * 4) and, based on pawn promotion choices, two additional variations.

All other rules are like chess 960 akka Fischer random chess
